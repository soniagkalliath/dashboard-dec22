        Angular - Front End Technology(HTML CSS TS)

    - Basic Commands 
        1. to install angular cli : npm i -g @angular/cli
        2. to create project : ng new project-name
        3. to run a project : ng serve
        4. to check angular version : ng v
        5. to generate component : ng g c component-name
        6. to generate Services : ng g s service-folder/service-name
        7. to create pipe : ng g p pipe-folder/pipe-name

    - Basic Building Blocks Of Angular
        1. Module : Root Module : AppModule
        2. Component : html,css,ts : Root Component- AppComponent
        3. Decorator
        4. To set up path for component : AppRoutingModule in Routes array
            {path:'component path', component:component-name}
            use router-outlet selector in AppComponent.html : To change according to the user 
        5. Data Binding : Shairing data within a component
        - One Way Binding: Data shairing will be held in one direction at a time
            - ts(component) to html(view)
                - String Interpolation: {{property name}} in html
                - Property Binding: [attribute-name] = "property name"
            - html(view) to ts(component)
                - Event Binding: (event-name)="function call()"
                - Event Binding using $event : (event-name) = "function call($event)"
                - Event Binding using template reference: #variable-name, (event-name) = "function call(variable-name)"
        - Two Way Binding: Data shairing will be held in both direction at a time
            - Using ngModel: [(ngModel)]="property-name" if it is inside a form tag the set the name property of that input tag
                    - Import FormsModule  in AppModule
        6. Dependenecy Injection : in constructor, 
            syntax: access-specifier variable-name : dependent-class-name
            access-specifier : public , private ,protected
        7. Angular Services : Share Common logic between components
        8. Directives : DOM Manipulation
            - Component Directives 
            - Structural Directives : To add / remove html elements based on class property
                - *ngFor="let variable-name of array-name" in html
                - *ngIf="condition" when condition is true then html elements will add else remove from DOM
            - Attribute Directives : based on class property we can apply style to html elements
                - inBuilt attribute Directives : ngClass
                - userdefined attribute Directives :
        9. Asynchronous Call - Resolving
            - RxJS - Reactive Extentension For Java Script
            - To resolve Asynchronous function angular uses
                - Observable : 
                    - subscribe(observer:call back function)
        10. API Call :
            - Import HttpClientModule to AppModule
            - Dependenecy Inject HttpClient to get http request
        11. ActivatedRoute class: Provides access to information about a route/url/path associated with a component 
            - params : to get path parameter from a url
        12. Angular Pipe : Transform user input to another format
            - syntax:
                {{ value_expression | pipe-operator [ : format [ : timezone [ : locale ] ] ] }}
        13. Angular Forms
            - Template Driven Forms : using ngModel to Binding
            - Validation in template Driven forms
        14. Angular with material design
        15. Communication between parent and child
            - 1. child to parent : output Decorator
            - 2. parent to child : input Decorator
        16. EventEmitter - To generate userdefined events
            - to occur an userdefined event use emit()
